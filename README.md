# Prework-Study-Guide-Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students going through Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. This study guide allows boot camp students to house notes, best practices, and suggestion that can be referred to and added to as students grow in this field. This Prework Study Guide project has taught me some basic coding  skills and given me a lot of repetitive practice that helps create muscle memory.
